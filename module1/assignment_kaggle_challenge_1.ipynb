        "- [ ] Define a function to wrangle train, validate, and test sets in the same way. Clean outliers and engineer features. (For example, [what other columns have zeros and shouldn't?](https://github.com/Quartz/bad-data-guide#zeros-replace-missing-values) What other columns are duplicates, or nearly duplicates? Can you extract the year from date_recorded? Can you engineer new features, such as the number of years from waterpump construction to waterpump inspection?)\n",
