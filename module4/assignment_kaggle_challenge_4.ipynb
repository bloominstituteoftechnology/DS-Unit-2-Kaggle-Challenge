    "- [ ] If you haven't yet, [review requirements for your portfolio project](https://lambdaschool.github.io/ds/unit2), then submit your dataset.\n",
    "- [ ] Plot a confusion matrix for your Tanzania Waterpumps model.\n",
    "- [ ] Continue to participate in our Kaggle challenge. Every student should have made at least one submission that scores at least 60% accuracy (above the majority class baseline).\n",
    "- [ ] Submit your final predictions to our Kaggle competition. Optionally, go to **My Submissions**, and _\"you may select up to 1 submission to be used to count towards your final leaderboard score.\"_\n",
    "- [ ] Commit your notebook to your fork of the GitHub repo.\n",
    "- [ ] Read [Maximizing Scarce Maintenance Resources with Data: Applying predictive modeling, precision at k, and clustering to optimize impact](https://towardsdatascience.com/maximizing-scarce-maintenance-resources-with-data-8f3491133050), by Lambda DS3 student Michael Brady.

    "- [Attacking discrimination with smarter machine learning](https://research.google.com/bigpicture/attacking-discrimination-in-ml/), by Google Research, with  interactive visualizations. _\"A threshold classifier essentially makes a yes/no decision, putting things in one category or another. We look at how these classifiers work, ways they can potentially be unfair, and how you might turn an unfair classifier into a fairer one. As an illustrative example, we focus on loan granting scenarios where a bank may grant or deny a loan based on a single, automatically computed number such as a credit score.\"_\n",
