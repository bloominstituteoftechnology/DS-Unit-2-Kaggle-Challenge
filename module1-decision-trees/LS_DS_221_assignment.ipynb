    "- [ ] Add your own stretch goal(s) !\n",
    "- [ ] Define a function to wrangle train, validate, and test sets in the same way. Clean outliers and engineer features. (For example, [what columns have zeros and shouldn't?](https://github.com/Quartz/bad-data-guide#zeros-replace-missing-values) What columns are duplicates, or nearly duplicates? Can you extract the year from date_recorded? Can you engineer new features, such as the number of years from waterpump construction to waterpump inspection?)\n",

    "#### Exploratory visualizations\n",
    "\n",
    "Visualize the relationships between feature(s) and target. I recommend you do this with your training set, after splitting your data. \n",
    "\n",
    "For this problem, you may want to create a new column to represent the target as a number, 0 or 1. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "train['functional'] = (train['status_group']=='functional').astype(int)\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "- Categorical features. (If there are too many unique values, you can replace less frequent values with \"OTHER.\")\n",
    "- Numeric features. (If there are too many unique values, you can [bin with pandas cut / qcut functions](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/getting_started/basics.html?highlight=qcut#discretization-and-quantiling).)\n",
    "\n",
    "You can try [Seaborn linear model plots](https://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial/regression.html) with numeric features. For this classification problem, you may want to use the parameter `logistic=True`, but it can be slow.\n",
    "\n",
    "You do _not_ need to use Seaborn, but it's nice because it includes confidence intervals to visualize uncertainty.\n",
