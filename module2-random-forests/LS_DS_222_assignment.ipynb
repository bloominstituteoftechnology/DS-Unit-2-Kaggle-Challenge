    "\n",
    "**1.** The article **[Categorical Features and Encoding in Decision Trees](https://medium.com/data-design/visiting-categorical-features-and-encoding-in-decision-trees-53400fa65931)** mentions 4 encodings:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **\"Categorical Encoding\":** This means using the raw categorical values as-is, not encoded. Scikit-learn doesn't support this, but some tree algorithm implementations do. For example, [Catboost](https://catboost.ai/), or R's [rpart](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rpart/index.html) package.\n",
    "- **Numeric Encoding:** Synonymous with Label Encoding, or \"Ordinal\" Encoding with random order. We can use [category_encoders.OrdinalEncoder](https://contrib.scikit-learn.org/category_encoders/ordinal.html).\n",
    "- **One-Hot Encoding:** We can use [category_encoders.OneHotEncoder](https://contrib.scikit-learn.org/category_encoders/onehot.html).\n",
    "- **Binary Encoding:** We can use [category_encoders.BinaryEncoder](https://contrib.scikit-learn.org/category_encoders/binary.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**2.** The short video \n",
    "**[Coursera — How to Win a Data Science Competition: Learn from Top Kagglers — Concept of mean encoding](https://www.coursera.org/lecture/competitive-data-science/concept-of-mean-encoding-b5Gxv)** introduces an interesting idea: use both X _and_ y to encode categoricals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Category Encoders has multiple implementations of this general concept:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [CatBoost Encoder](https://contrib.scikit-learn.org/category_encoders/catboost.html)\n",
    "- [Generalized Linear Mixed Model Encoder](https://contrib.scikit-learn.org/category_encoders/glmm.html)\n",
    "- [James-Stein Encoder](https://contrib.scikit-learn.org/category_encoders/jamesstein.html)\n",
    "- [Leave One Out](https://contrib.scikit-learn.org/category_encoders/leaveoneout.html)\n",
    "- [M-estimate](https://contrib.scikit-learn.org/category_encoders/mestimate.html)\n",
    "- [Target Encoder](https://contrib.scikit-learn.org/category_encoders/targetencoder.html)\n",
    "- [Weight of Evidence](https://contrib.scikit-learn.org/category_encoders/woe.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "Category Encoder's mean encoding implementations work for regression problems or binary classification problems. \n",
    "\n",
    "For multi-class classification problems, you will need to temporarily reformulate it as binary classification. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "encoder = ce.TargetEncoder(min_samples_leaf=..., smoothing=...) # Both parameters > 1 to avoid overfitting\n",
    "X_train_encoded = encoder.fit_transform(X_train, y_train=='functional')\n",
    "X_val_encoded = encoder.transform(X_train, y_val=='functional')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For this reason, mean encoding won't work well within pipelines for multi-class classification problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3.** The **[dirty_cat](https://dirty-cat.github.io/stable/)** library has a Target Encoder implementation that works with multi-class classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    " dirty_cat.TargetEncoder(clf_type='multiclass-clf')\n",
    "```\n",
    "It also implements an interesting idea called [\"Similarity Encoder\" for dirty categories](https://www.slideshare.net/GaelVaroquaux/machine-learning-on-non-curated-data-154905090).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it seems like dirty_cat doesn't handle missing values or unknown categories as well as category_encoders does. And you may need to use it with one column at a time, instead of with your whole dataframe.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. [Embeddings](https://www.kaggle.com/colinmorris/embedding-layers)** can work well with sparse / high cardinality categoricals.\n",
    "\n",
    "_**I hope it’s not too frustrating or confusing that there’s not one “canonical” way to encode categoricals. It’s an active area of research and experimentation — maybe you can make your own contributions!**_"
