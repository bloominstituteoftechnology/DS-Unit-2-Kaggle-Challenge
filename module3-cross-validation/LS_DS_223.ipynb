    "\n",
    "> When evaluating different settings (“hyperparameters”) for estimators, there is still a risk of overfitting on the test set because the parameters can be tweaked until the estimator performs optimally. This way, knowledge about the test set can “leak” into the model and evaluation metrics no longer report on generalization performance. To solve this problem, yet another part of the dataset can be held out as a so-called “validation set”: training proceeds on the training set, after which evaluation is done on the validation set, and when the experiment seems to be successful, final evaluation can be done on the test set.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> However, **by partitioning the available data into three sets, we drastically reduce the number of samples which can be used for learning the model, and the results can depend on a particular random choice for the pair of (train, validation) sets.**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> **A solution to this problem is a procedure called cross-validation (CV for short). A test set should still be held out for final evaluation, but the validation set is no longer needed when doing CV.** \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://scikit-learn.org/stable/_images/grid_search_cross_validation.png\" width=\"600\">\n",
    "\n",
    "> In the basic approach, called k-fold CV, the training set is split into k smaller sets. The following procedure is followed for each of the k “folds”:\n",
    ">\n",
    "> - A model is trained using $k-1$ of the folds as training data;\n",
    "> - the resulting model is validated on the remaining part of the data (i.e., it is used as a test set to compute a performance measure such as accuracy).\n",
    ">\n",
    "> The performance measure reported by k-fold cross-validation is then the average of the values computed in the loop. **This approach can be computationally expensive, but does not waste too much data (as is the case when fixing an arbitrary validation set).**"
